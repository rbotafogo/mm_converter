=== Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests ===

All official releases of TaskJuggler are meant to be stable releases
unless explicitly noted differently. But our test suite is still very
small and some features are not tested at all. So it's very likely
that your current version of TaskJuggler contains some bugs. If you
find a bug, please follow this procedure:

* Read this manual to make sure that it is actually a bug and not a
feature.

* Check the [http://www.taskjuggler.org TaskJuggler web page] and the
[http://www.taskjuggler.org/contact.html discussion groups]. You should
also search the [https://github.com/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler/issues
issue tracker] if the problem has been reported before. If so, it's
quite likely that there is already a workaround or fix available. 

* Try to create a test project that is as small as possible but still
reproduces the bug.

* If TaskJuggler has crashed you will usually get some debug output. This
may not make any sense to you but it is vital information to analyze
the bug. Please include it completely in your bug report. Use the
following command to store the messages into a file.

 tj3 yourproject.tjp 2> error_message

* Enter a detailed description of the problem into the
[https://github.com/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler/issues?state=open issue
tracker] and don't forget to attach your test project and the error
log. You can paste that into the input field.

* Not attaching a test project will severely limit our abilities to help
you. In 95% of the reported bugs we need a test case to find and fix
the problem. Please make sure you provide meaningful descriptions and a small
but complete test project.  Not providing this information with the
first bug report means we have to follow up with you or the bug report
is being ignored.

* Please open a new issue for each bug. Don't include multiple
problems in one bug report. This usually leads to one bug being fixed
and the rest of the problems to be ignored.

* If you have a feature request, please open a new issue and set the
"Feature" label.
