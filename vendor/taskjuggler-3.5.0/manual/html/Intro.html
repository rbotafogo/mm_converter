    <h2 class="manual" id="About_TaskJuggler">1.1 About TaskJuggler</h2>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful project management tool. Its new approach to project planning and tracking is far superior to the commonly used Gantt chart editing tools. It has already been successfully used in many projects and scales to projects with hundreds of resources and thousands of tasks.</p>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler is an Open Source tool for serious project managers. It covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the first idea to the completion of the project without enforcing certain work flows or methodologies. It assists you during project scoping, resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk and communication management, status tracking and reporting.</p>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your project time lines and resource assignments based on the project outline and the constrains that you have provided. The built-in resource balancer and constrains checker offload you from having to worry about irrelevant details and ring the alarm if the project gets out of hand. The flexible "as many details as necessary"-approach allows you to still plan your project as you go, making it also ideal for new management strategies such as Extreme Programming and Agile Project Management.</p>
    <p class="manual">If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together your colleague's shift plan for the next month, TaskJuggler is the right tool for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt charts to impress your boss or your investors, TaskJuggler might not be right for you. It can certainly produce nice looking Gantt charts and other reports, but it takes some effort to master its power. For those that are willing to invest a few hours to get started with the software it will become a companion you don't want to miss anymore.</p>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler is a commandline tool that you use from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)" target="_top">shell</a>. This means that to enter your project data you will use one of the most versatile and powerful tools there is: your favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor" target="_top">text editor</a>. To get a first impression, you can look at this <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/examples/Tutorial/tutorial.tjp" target="_top">project file</a>. The project description is fairly intuitive, but very powerful as well. The <a href="Tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> will explain this file line by line. Please look at the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/examples/Overview.html" target="_top">resulting reports</a> that visualize the project.</p>
